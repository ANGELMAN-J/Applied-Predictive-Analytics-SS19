Do A/B testing to:
a) estimate treatment effect
b) evaluate current response model

Compare standard A/B test to our method:
a) iso-expected cost (/risk) > expected deviation from true effect (empirically estimated by running whole thing multiple times)
b) iso-accuracy > estimate cost for same expected accuracy

1. Simulate data
- Setting: churn modeling
	- response: churn yes/no
	- variables: current LTV, Recency/Frequency/M whatever score
	- decide on typical error costs for evaluation in real terms
- known treatment effect
- some relationship of X with y plus noise


2. Build initial response model which imperfectly captures the relationship
- logistic regression for simplicity
- generate some data to train model

3.
A) do standard A/B testing
- assign randomly
- evaluate Cost and Accuracy
B) do our method
- assign proportional to predicted response
-Evaluate Cost and Accuracy
